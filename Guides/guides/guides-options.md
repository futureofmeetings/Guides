# Platform options
When choosing a platform we must ask ourselves the following questions:
- How many people will be attending?
- What are their accessibility needs?
- What hardware do they have access to?
- What is the objective of the meeting (presenting findings, discussing ideas, social network building, ...) 

Another important consideration is the effort available to set up and run the event, including any demos and training for attendees.

Here we are covering a number of major and lesser known platforms that may be of use for the research community.
