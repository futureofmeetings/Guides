#### We recommend:
- Wear headphones 
- Use Google Chrome (preferred) or Firefox 
- Spend some time exploring!

#### Gather permission:
Allow Gather to access your **camera** and **microphone**
To toggle your camera/microphone once you are in the Gather space, there are controls.

#### Gather Tips:
**Move around.** After choosing your name and avatar you will enter the Gather space for
the first time. You can use the W-A-S-D keys or arrow keys to move around.
 
**Zoom.** If you find the map is too zoomed in (quite likely when you first appear), you can 
turn off “smart zoom”. Click on the “grapes” picture on the bottom left of your screen ->
“Settings” -> “Appearance” -> “Use Smart Zoom” and turn this off. You can then zoom 
as you would normally (e.g. mouse wheel).

**Audio** is proximity-based, so to talk to someone else, just walk up to their avatar. When
you are close enough, you will be able to hear each other and see the other person’s
webcam.

**Emojis:** Emojis are a great way to show your reaction to the whole room! Find them at
the bottom of your screen. Click to or use the corresponding numbers to display one
and it will show above your head. If you need help, or want to ask a question, try _raising
your hand_ (emoji 6). This emoji will stay visible until you click again to remove it, all the
others will fade over time.

**Screen sharing + interaction:**  To share your screen click the screen icon on the
bottom control panel (1), you’ll be prompted to share your entire screen, one window or
a chrome tab. If a screen is being shared (by you or someone else) and you want to ask
a question, click the mouse icon at the top (2) to share your cursor. When you click on
the   screenshare   your   name   and   click   location   will   be   visible   to   everyone   (3).

**Megaphone:** It’s time to speak, and the whole room needs to hear! Stand on one of the
orange circles in the talk rooms, and everyone in that room will be able to hear you. A
megaphone symbol will appear beside your name, and at the bottom of your screen.
Remember to step off the hot spot when you want to go quiet again.
 
**Finding people:** If you want to find someone who is currently in the Gather space, click
on the people icon on the bottom right of your screen to bring up a list of people. Then
click on the person you want to find and you can either locate them on the map, or
‘follow’ them – this will lead you right to them no matter where they are! Just remember
to ‘unfollow’ once you get together, otherwise you’ll continue to track their movements. 

**Chat** can be found on the right-hand side of the bottom control panel, third button from
the right (it looks like speech bubbles). Here you can send a message to an individual,
anyone ‘nearby’ (i.e. anyone you can hear speaking and see in the videos at the top of
the screen) or everyone in the Gather room.

**Gallery view** is used to see the video feeds of everyone nearby. To enable it, click the
diagonal arrows in the top right. You can also scroll through the videos using the left
and right arrows.
 
**Peace & Quiet:** If you like a quiet environment and the private space just doesn’t cut it,
you can *mute* other users’ audio and video by pressing the buttons on their feed (left). If
you want to stop any audio/video connections more permanently you can *block* them
from their profile (right). 

***Note:*** muting and blocking only affects your ability to see and hear a user, not anyone else’s
ability to. Don’t forget to unmute/unblock once you’re ready to start interacting again!

#### When you want to go:
To **leave Gather** just close the tab! When you want to return, enter the address of your
Gather space into the address bar and follow the prompts. Your avatar will be placed
back in exactly the same place as when you left.
