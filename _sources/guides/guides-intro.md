# Introduction to TFoM platform guides

These guides cover the main considerations in setting up, and using, various virual meeting platforms.
We tried to list the platform options readily available to researchers for the purposes of virtual/online collaboration. 
We then describe these options in detail, highlighting pros and cons of each, accessibility, ease of use, and other considerations.
We focus on platforms we are familiar with that are or could be used for virtual meetings and collaboraiton. If you are aware of others that we didn't cover please contact us by [creating an issue](https://github.com/futureofmeetings/Guides/issues/new/choose).
